# LLMs-IGTv6
# IGTv6 LLMs (10B+ parameters), trained to answer users' questions naturally like a human with a huge amount of knowledge and continuous updates.
# There are many versions from 1B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B, 6B (mid-range segment), 7B, 8B, 9B, 10B+ parameters.
# The parameters are mainly about code, online information, wiki pages, and the ability to identify good questions and high quality feedback.

# Summary of how it works:
# User text input: The user enters a question into the interface.
# Sentiment Analysis: The system analyzes the sentiment of the question to determine whether the response should contain elements of humor or entertainment.
# Response generation: The IGTv6 model generates responses based on the conversation context.
# Improve feedback: Add a personal element (humor or encouragement) to feedback based on emotion and context.
# Storing conversation history: Conversations are stored into FAISS to ensure the model can refer back to information in the future.
# Show response: The response is displayed in the user interface.
# Through these steps, the system not only generates a response based on previous information but also improves the spontaneity and cohesion of the conversation.
